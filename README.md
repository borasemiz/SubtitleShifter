# Subtitle Shifter

A simple commandline application that has only one functionality: shift times of SubRip (.srt) formatted subtitle files.

For example, this command alters the timing of each subtitle in the `my_subtitle_file.srt` by 1.5 seconds.

```
# SubtitleShifter <subtitlefile> <(-/+)amount_of_milliseconds>
SubtitleShifter my_subtitle_file.srt -1500
```

Enjoy!
